# LLMops Project

This project is a coding initiative that leverages Python, Langfuse, and other tools for LLMops (Large Language Model Operations). The goal is to develop a creative and practical skill that keeps the mind engaged while potentially opening career opportunities. The project is hosted on GitHub and focuses on building and deploying a machine learning model.

## Overview

The project centers on creating a machine learning model using Langfuse and related technologies. This model is trained on a dataset and designed to make predictions, serving as a hands-on exploration of LLMops workflows and best practices.

## Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Download the project files to your local machine:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/llmops-project.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up the Environment**  
   Run the setup script to configure the project environment:  
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

4. **Download the Dataset**  
   Fetch the necessary dataset for training the model:  
   ```bash
   python download_data.py
   ```

## Running the Project

To execute the project and see it in action, use the following command:  
```bash
python main.py
```  
This will train the model on the dataset and generate predictions on a test set.

## Using the Project

You can interact with the project in two primary ways:

1. **Train the Model**  
   Train or retrain the model with:  
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. **Make Predictions**  
   Use the trained model to make predictions:  
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

Additionally, you can integrate the model into your own Python code by importing the `model` module:  
```python
from model import MyModel
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Create a personal copy of the project on GitHub.

2. **Create a New Branch**  
   Work on your changes in a dedicated branch:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**  
   Implement your feature or fix, ensuring code quality.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**
